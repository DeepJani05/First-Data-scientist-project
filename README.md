Project Description
The project focuses on creating a predictive model for BigMart's sales data from 2013, which contains information about 1,559 products sold across 10 different stores. The primary goal is to predict the sales of individual products at specific stores. The insights from the model will help BigMart identify the key attributes of products and stores that contribute to higher sales and assist in strategic decision-making to enhance overall performance.

The dataset has missing values due to occasional reporting glitches, which are addressed as part of the data preprocessing. The project follows a structured approach comprising several steps, including exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, handling categorical variables, and implementing machine learning models.

Key Objectives
Sales Prediction: Build a model to predict the sales of individual products at different stores.
Insights Generation: Analyze how product and store attributes influence sales.
Error Handling: Treat missing values and outliers to improve model performance.
Steps Undertaken
Problem Statement Definition:
Articulated the goal to predict product sales at specific stores and identify impactful factors.

Data Loading and Preprocessing:

Merged training and testing datasets.
Handled missing values for features like Item_Weight and Outlet_Size.
Treated outliers in Item_Outlet_Sales using statistical techniques.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Conducted univariate analysis (box plots, violin plots) to understand individual features.
Performed bivariate analysis using correlation matrices and heatmaps.
Visualized relationships with plots like bar charts and joint plots.
Feature Engineering:

Treated categorical variables (Item_Fat_Content, Outlet_Size, etc.) with label encoding and one-hot encoding.
Replaced inconsistent labels to ensure uniformity.
Model Development:

Linear Regression: A baseline predictive model.
Regularized Models: Lasso regression for feature selection.
Ensemble Models: Random Forest and Gradient Boosting for improved performance.
Model Evaluation:
Compared the performance of different models using metrics like RÂ² scores and retained the most accurate model for predictions.

Prediction on Test Data:
Applied the trained model to unseen test data to generate sales predictions.

Deployment:
Saved the trained model using Joblib and used it to predict and save the output as a CSV file.

Outcome
The project successfully predicted product sales, and the trained models demonstrated significant accuracy. Insights derived from the analysis can assist BigMart in:

Adjusting pricing strategies.
Stocking popular products effectively.
Optimizing store attributes to boost sales.
By combining data preprocessing, advanced analytics, and machine learning techniques, the project highlights how data science can drive impactful business decisions.
